# Solutions to Project Euler in Ruby

This is simply a repository I created so I could keep track of (and publish) my solutions to problems at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/). I'm using Ruby 1.9.3 if you're curious.

Don't read what's in the `solutions` directory unless you want (my version of) the answers!
